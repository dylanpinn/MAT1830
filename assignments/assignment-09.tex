\section*{Question 1}

A biased coin flips heads with probability $\frac{4}{9}$ and tails with
probability $\frac{5}{9}$. The coin is flipped 90 times. What is the probability
that heads is flipped exactly 40 times?

\begin{align*}
  \Pr(H) &= \frac{4}{9} \\
  \Pr(T) &= \frac{5}{9} \\
  \Pr(X = k) &= \binom{n}{k} p^k {(1-p)}^{n-k} \text{ for } k \in \{ 0,
    \dots, n \} \\
  n &= 90 \\
  k &= 40 \\
  p &= \frac{4}{9} \\
  \Pr(X = 40) &= \binom{90}{40} {\frac{4}{9}}^{40} {(1-\frac{4}{9})}^{90-40} \\
  &= \frac{90!}{40!50!} \times \frac{4^{40}}{9^{40}} \times
  \frac{5^{50}}{9^{50}} \\
  &\approx 0.08
\end{align*}

\section*{Question 2}

Cars pass through a road junction according to a Poisson distribution. An
average of 5 cars per minute pass through the junction.

\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
  \item What is the probability that exactly one car passes through the
    junction in a certain minute?

  \item Write down the expected number of cards to pass through the junction in
    four minutes.

  \item What is the probability that exactly 10 cars pass through the junction
    in a certain four minute period?

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 3}

A random variable $Y$ can only take values in $ \{ -5, 0, 5 \}$. The expected
value of $Y$ is 0 and its variance is 24. Find the probability distribution of
$Y$.

\section*{Question 4}

Write down the first five values $(r_0, \dots, r_4 \text{ and } s_0, \dots,
s_4)$ of each of the following recursive sequences.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
  \item $r_0 = 2$, $r_n = {(r_{n-1})}^2 - 3n + 1$ for all integers $n \geq 1$.

  \item $s_0 = 2$, $s_n = {(s_{n-1})}^2 + {(s_{n-2})}^2 + \cdots + {(s_0)}^2$
  for all integers $n \geq 1$.

\end{enumerate}
