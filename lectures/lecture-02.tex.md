# Lecture 2 - Divisors and Primes

**Definitiion:**
An _integer_ is a "whole number". It may be positive or negative or zero.

## 2.1 Primes

A positive integer $p > 1$ is a prime if its only positive integer divisors are
1 and $p$.

**Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:**

_Each integer $> 1$ can be expressed in exactly one way, up to order, as a
product of primes._

**Example.**

$$210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7$$

and this is the only product of primes which equals $210$.

## Recognising primes

If an integer $n > 1$ has a divisor, it has a divisor $<= \sqrt{n}$, because for
any divisor $a > \sqrt{n}$ we also have the divisor $n / a$, which is $<
\sqrt{n}$.
