# Lecture 4 - Logic

The simplest and most commonly used part of logic is the logic of "and", "or"
and "not", which is known as _propositional logic_.
A proposition is any sentence which has a definite truth value (true = **T** or
false = **F**), such as
$$1 + 1 = 2, \text {or}$$
$$11 \text{ is a prime number.}$$
but not

What is your name? Or

This sentence is false

Propositions are denoted by letters such as $p, q, r, \dots,$ and they are
combined into compound propositions by _connectives_ such as $\land$ (and),
$\lor$ (or) and $\neg$ (not).

## Question 4.1

Which of the following are propositions?

$$1 = 1 = 3 \text { Yes } \text{ (false) }$$
$$1 + 1 \text { No}$$
$$3 \text { divides } 9 \text{ Yes } \text{ (true)}$$
$$3 \div 7 \text { No}$$
