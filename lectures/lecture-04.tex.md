# Lecture 4 - Logic

The simplest and most commonly used part of logic is the logic of "and", "or"
and "not", which is known as _propositional logic_.
A proposition is any sentence which has a definite truth value (true = **T** or
false = **F**), such as
$$1 + 1 = 2, \text {or}$$
$$11 \text{is a prime number}$$
