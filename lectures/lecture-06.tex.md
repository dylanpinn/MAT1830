## 6.1 The rule of replacement

Why can we say that $(\frac{2x}{2}^2 = x^2$?

Because $\frac{2x}{2} = x$.

And there's a rule of replacement.

It's the same in logic except with $\equiv$ instead of $=$.

So we can say that $p \land \neg(q \lor r) \equiv (p \land (\neg q \land \neg
r)$ because $\neg (q \lor r) \equiv \neg q \land \neg r$.
