# Lecture 11: Sets

**Sets - why should you care?**

- Sets are an important data structure when programming.
- Sets are very important concepts CS and maths.
- Set notation is used a lot in writing about CS and maths.
- The standard approach to building maths up from logic is based on sets.

Sets are vital in expressing mathematics formally and are also very important
data structures in computer science.

A set is basically just an unordered collection of distinct objects, which we
call its _elements_ or _members_. Note that there is no notion of order for a
set, even though we often write down its elements in some order for convenience.
Also, there is no notion of multiplicity: an object is either in a set or not -
it cannot be in the set multiple times.

Sets _A_ and _B_ are equal when every element of _A_ is an element of _B_ and
vice-versa.

## 11.1 Set notation

- $x \in S$ means that _x_ is an element of set _S_.
