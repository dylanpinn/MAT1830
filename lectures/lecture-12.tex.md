# Lecture 12: Operations on Sets

There is an "arithmetic" of sets similar to ordinary arithmetic. There are
operations similar to addition, subtraction and multiplication.

## 12.1 Venn diagrams

The simple operations on sets can be visualised with the help of _Venn
diagrams_, which show sets $A,B,C,\dots$ as disks within a rectangle
representing the universal set $U$.

## 12.2 Union

The union $A \cup B$ of sets $A$ and $B$ consists of the elements in $A$ _or_
$B$, and is indicated by the shaded region in the following Venn diagram.

## 12.3 Intersection

The intersection $A \cap B$ of sets $A$ and $B$ consists of the elements in $A$
_and_ $B$, indicated by the shaded region in the following Venn diagram.
