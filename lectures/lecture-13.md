# Lecture 13: Functions

**Functions - why should you care?**

The concept of a function is extremely important in both computer science and
maths.

- Functions (subroutines) in programming are closely related to functions in the
  mathematical sense.
- In the case of functional programming languages (e.g. Lisp, Haskell, Rust)
  they are exactly functions in the mathematical sense.
- Functions are used to define a lot of important concepts in maths and
  theoretical computer science.
