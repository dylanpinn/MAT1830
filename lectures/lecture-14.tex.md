# Lecture 14: Examples of Functions

The functions discussed in the last lecture were familiar functions of real
numbers. Many other examples occur elsewhere, however.

## 14.1 Functions of several variables

We might define a function sum $: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$ by sum $(x,y) = x + y$.

Because the domain of this function is $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, the
inputs to this function are ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers. Because its
codomain in $\mathbb{R}$, we are guaranteed that each output will be a real
number. This function can be thought of as a function of two variables $x$ and
$y$.

Similarly we might define a function binomial $: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}
\times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by binomial $(a,b,n) = (a+b)^n$.

Here the inputs are ordered triples $(x,y,n)$ such that $x$ and $y$ are real
numbers and $n$ is a natural number. We can think of this as a function of three
variables.
