# Lecture 16: Relations

**Relations - why should you care?**

- Relations are used heavily in database theory in computer science.
- They are also used in theories of object orientation in programming.
- Relations can be thought of as a generalisation of functions.
- Like there is a functional programming paradigm there's a relational
  programming paradigm.
