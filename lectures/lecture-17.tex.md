# Lecture 17: Equivalence Relations

An _equivalence relation_ $R$ on a set $A$ is a binary relation with the
following three properties.

1. Reflexivity: $aRA$ for all $a \in A$.
2. Symmetry: $aRb \Rightarrow bRa$ for all $a,b \in A$.
3. Transitivity: $aRb$ and $bRc \Rightarrow aRc$ for all $a,b,c \in A$.

Equality and congruence mod $n$ (for fixed $n$) are examples of equivalence
relations.

**Reflexivity** (For a binary relation $R$ on a set $A$).

To prove that $R$ is reflexive, show that; For all $x \in A, xRx$

To prove that $R$ is not reflexive, show that; There is an $x \in A$ such that
$x \not R x$.

**Question** Let $R$ be the relation on $A$ pictured below. Is $R$ reflexive?

Yes. $xRx$ for all $x \in A$.

**Question** Let $S$ be the relation on $A$ pictured below. Is $S$ reflexive?

No. $4 \not S 4$.
