# Lecture 18: Order Relations

## 18.1 Partial order relations

A _partial order relation R_ on a set _A_ is a binary relation with the
following three properties.

1. Reflexivity. $aRa$ for all $a \in A$.
2. Antisymmetry. $aRb$ and $bRa \Rightarrow a = b$ for all $a,b \in A$.
3. Transitivity. $aRb$ and $bRc \Rightarrow aRc$ for all $a,b,c \in A$.
