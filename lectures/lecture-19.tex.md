# Lecture 19: Selections and Arrangements

## Ordered selections without repetition

The number of ordered selections without repetition of $r$ elements from a set
of $n$ elements $(9 \leq r \leq n)$ is:

$$n(n-1) \dots (n-r+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$

When $r=n$ and all the elements of a set $S$ are ordered, we just say that this
is a _permutation_ of $S$. Our formula tells us there are $n!$ such
permutations. For example, there are $3! = 6$ permutations of the set
$\{a,b,c\}$.
