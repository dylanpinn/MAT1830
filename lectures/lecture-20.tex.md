# Lecture 20: Pascal's triangle and the binomial theorem

## Patterns

Choosing $r$ elements from a set of $n$ elements to be in a combination is
equivalent to choosing $n-r$ elements from the same set to not be in the
combination. So:

$$\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r} \text{ for } 0 \leq r \leq n$$
