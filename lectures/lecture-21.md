# Lecture 12: Probability and Independence

Why should you care?

- Many algorithms work better if they make random choices. For example,
  "quicksort" can avoid its worst case by making random choices. The Pollard-p
  factorisation algorithm makes random choices as it searches for integer
  factors. To understand such algorithms you must understand probability.
- Many mathematical objects can only be constructed randomly. For example,
  graphs with large chromatic number but no short cycles.
- Random models are useful for studying the structure of real world networks.
  And of traffic modelling on them.
- Probability also helps in machine learning, reliability modelling, simulation
  algorithms, data mining, speech recognition, etc.

Probability gives us a way to model random processes mathematically. These
processes could be anything from the rolling of dice, to radioactive decay of
atoms, to the performance of a stock market index. The mathematical environment
we work in when dealing with probabilities is called a probability space.
