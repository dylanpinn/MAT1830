# Lecture 22: Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem

## Conditional probability

Conditional probabilities measure the likelihood of an event, given that some
other event occurs.

For events _A_ and _B_, the _conditional probability of A given B_ is

**Example** A spinner is spun. Let _A_ be the event that the result was at elast
3 and _B_ be the event that the result was even. What is <img src="/lectures/tex/55fc1799f50d66462cc650ec731dc094.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=60.59946749999999pt height=24.65753399999998pt/>?
