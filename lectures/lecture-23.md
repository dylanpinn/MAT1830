# Lecture 23: Random variables

In a game, three standard dice will be rolled and the number of sixes will be
recorded. We could let _X_ stand for the number of sixes rolled. Then _X_ is a
special kind of variable whose value is based on a random process. These are
called _random variables_.

Because the value of _X_ is random, it doesn't make sense to ask whether <img src="/lectures/tex/5a8dcb8ad1298f287084a6a4446167f3.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=45.04550654999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>, for example. But we can ask what the _probability is_ that <img src="/lectures/tex/bca0701b83e430a17ccc917b8bc3da06.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=45.04550654999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> or that <img src="/lectures/tex/353cd32c9d5684716f79173e2cbdff35.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=45.04550654999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>. This is because "<img src="/lectures/tex/bca0701b83e430a17ccc917b8bc3da06.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=45.04550654999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>" and "<img src="/lectures/tex/7062decdde4d09083037326793f150fb.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=45.04550654999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>" correspond to events from our
sample space.
